The multiplication operator is a mathematical symbol represented by an "x" or "•" symbol, and it is used to indicate that two or more quantities
should be multiplied together to obtain a product.

For example, if you have two numbers, say 2 and 3, you can use the multiplication operator to find their product, which is 6. 
Instead of writing out "2 times 3 equals 6," you can simply write "2 x 3 = 6" or "2 • 3 = 6".

In general, if you have two numbers a and b, you can use the multiplication operator to find their product, which is denoted by a*b or a•b.
The product of a and b is the result of multiplying a by b.
