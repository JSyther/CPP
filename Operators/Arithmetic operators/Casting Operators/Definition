There are several casting operators specific to the C++ language. 
These operators are intended to remove some of the ambiguity and danger inherent in old style C language casts.

These operators are:

* dynamic_cast      : Used for conversion of polymorphic types.

* static_cast       : Used for conversion of nonpolymorphic types.

* const_cast        : Used to remove the const, volatile, and __unaligned attributes.

* reinterpret_cast  : Used for simple reinterpretation of bits.

* safe_cast         : Used in C++/CLI to produce verifiable MSIL.

Use const_cast and reinterpret_cast as a last resort, since these operators present the same dangers as old style casts.
However, they are still necessary in order to completely replace old style casts.
