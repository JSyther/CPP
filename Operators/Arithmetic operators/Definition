Arithmetic operators in C++ are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values. 
There are five basic arithmetic operators in C++:

Addition (+)        : used to add two values together.
Subtraction (-)     : used to subtract one value from another.
Multiplication (*)  : used to multiply two values together.
Division (/)        : used to divide one value by another.
Modulus (%)         : used to find the remainder after division.

In addition to these basic arithmetic operators, C++ also provides some shorthand operators that combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment operation. 
For example, += is equivalent to a = a + b, where a and b are variables.

It's important to note that arithmetic operators follow the usual rules of arithmetic,
such as the order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction) and the fact that division by zero is undefined.
