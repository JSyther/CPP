 C++ has several built-in data types, which are used to define variables and store data in the program. Here's a list of the most commonly used data types in C++:

int: Represents an integer value, such as -3, 0, or 42. int values are stored as binary numbers and have a range of values that depend on the implementation.

float: Represents a floating-point value, such as 1.23 or -3.14. float values are stored as approximations of real numbers and have a finite precision.

double: Represents a double-precision floating-point value, which has a greater range and precision than float. double values are stored as approximations of real numbers and are used for high-precision calculations.

char: Represents a single character, such as 'a' or 'z'. char values are stored as numbers and can also be used to represent ASCII codes.

bool: Represents a boolean value, either true or false. bool values are used to represent logical conditions in the program.

string: Represents a sequence of characters, such as "hello" or "world". string values are stored as arrays of characters and are commonly used for text manipulation.

Here's an example that declares variables of different data types in C++:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int a = 42;
    float b = 3.14;
    double c = 6.02214086;
    char d = 'A';
    bool e = true;
    std::string f = "Hello, World!";

    std::cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << " " << d << " " << e << " " << f << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

This program declares and initializes variables of different data types, and then prints their values to the console using the cout function from the iostream
library. The output of this program will be:

42 3.14 6.02214 6 1 Hello, World!


C++ is a strongly-typed language, which means that variables must be declared with a specific data type, and their values must conform to that data type.
C++ supports implicit and explicit type conversion, which allows you to convert values between different data types.
Implicit conversions are automatic and may cause data loss, while explicit conversions require a cast operator to be specified.
Some data types have additional type specifiers, such as short and long, which can be used to further refine the size and range of the data type.
The sizeof operator can be used to determine the size of a data type in bytes, which can be useful for memory management and optimization.
