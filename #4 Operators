C++ provides several types of operators for performing various operations such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and others. Let's discuss each type in detail:

Arithmetic Operators:
+: Adds two operands.
-: Subtracts second operand from the first.
*: Multiply two operands.
/: Divide the first operand by the second.
%: Takes modulo using two operands.
Example:

int a = 10, b = 20;
int c = a + b; // c = 30
int d = a - b; // d = -10
int e = a * b; // e = 200
int f = b / a; // f = 2
int g = b % a; // g = 0
Comparison Operators:
==: Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.
!=: Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.
>: Checks if the value of the first operand is greater than the second.
<: Checks if the value of the first operand is less than the second.
>=: Checks if the value of the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
<=: Checks if the value of the first operand is less than or equal to the second.
Example:


int a = 10, b = 20;
bool c = (a == b); // false
bool d = (a != b); // true
bool e = (a > b);  // false
bool f = (a < b);  // true
bool g = (a >= b); // false
bool h = (a <= b); // true
Logical Operators:
&&: Logical AND. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
||: Logical OR. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
!: Logical NOT. Reverses the logical state of its operand.
Example:

int a = 10, b = 20;
bool c = (a && b); // true
bool d = (a || b); // true
bool e = !a;       // false
Assignment Operators:
=: Simple assignment operator. Assigns the value of the second operand to the first operand.
+=: Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
-=: Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
*=: Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
/=: Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
%=: Modulo AND assignment operator. It takes modulo using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:

int a = 10, b = 20;
a = b;      // a = 20
a += b;     // a = 40
a -= b;     // a = 20
a *= b;     // a = 400
a /= b;     // a = 20
a %= b;     // a = 0
Increment and Decrement Operators:
++: Increments the operand by 1.
--: Decrements the operand by 1.
Example:

int a = 10;
a++;      // a = 11
a--;      // a = 10
++a;      // a = 11
--a;      // a = 10
Conditional Operators:
?:: Conditional operator. If the first operand is true, then the result is the second operand, otherwise, it is the third operand.
Example:

int a = 10, b = 20;
int c = (a > b) ? a : b;  // c = 20
Bitwise Operators:
&: Bitwise AND.
|: Bitwise OR.
^: Bitwise XOR.
~: Bitwise NOT.
<<: Left shift.
>>: Right shift.
Example:

int a = 10, b = 20;
int c = a & b;    // c = 0
int d = a | b;    // d = 30
int e = a ^ b;    // e = 30
int f = ~a;       // f = -11
int g = a << 1;   // g = 20
int h = a >> 1;   // h = 5
This is a comprehensive list of the different types of operators available in C++ with examples.
